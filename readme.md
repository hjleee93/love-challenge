## 💖 What I Built

For the **Frontend Challenge - February Edition, Glam Up My Markup: Love Language Discovery**, I built a **Love Language Discovery Platform** based on the provided **starter HTML**.

Without modifying the HTML structure, I focused on enhancing interactivity and design using only **CSS** and **JavaScript**.  
The **main goal** was to create a fun and engaging experience for users to explore different ways of giving and receiving love.

### 🚀 Key Features Implemented

- 💕 **Heart Effect:**  
  A cute interaction where hearts appear every time the user clicks, adding a lovely touch to the experience.

- 📱 **Bottom Navigation:**  
  A **bottom navigation bar** to help users easily navigate between different sections of the page.

- 💌 **Discover Love (Card View):**  
  Love languages are displayed in a card format, making it more intuitive and fun for users to explore.

- 💞 **Love Quiz (Quiz Feature):**  
  A **quiz feature** that allows users to find out their preferred love language in an interactive way.

- 📖 **Love Story (Carousel):**  
  Instead of static text, love stories are displayed in a **carousel format** for a more engaging and dynamic experience.

- 🎯 **Random Love Language Challenge:**  
  A **random daily love language challenge** is presented to encourage users to practice different expressions of love every day.

## 🛤️ Journey

This challenge allowed me to explore creative ways to enhance interactivity in a **restricted environment**, where I couldn't modify the HTML structure. It was a great opportunity to focus on **CSS** and **JavaScript** to bring the project to life.

### ✨ What I Learned

1. **Creativity in a Restricted Environment:**  
   - Working without the ability to modify the HTML forced me to think creatively about how to implement new interactions using only **JavaScript** and **CSS**.

2. **Simple Features Can Improve UX:**  
   - Even simple features like the **heart click effect** and **random challenge generator** can significantly enhance user engagement.

3. **Understanding the Importance of Future Improvements:**  
   - Although I couldn't implement every feature within the time constraints, I was able to identify key areas for future improvement.
